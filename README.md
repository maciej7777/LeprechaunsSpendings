# LeprechaunsSpendings
A tool for managing family budget. Users should be able to report spendings via the apps, and at the end of the month they should be able to calculate how much money should be transfered between the users in order to divide the spedings equally.

# Backend implementation
The first requirement for the backend app includes following operations:
```
GET spendings by month
/spendings?months=[]

{
    [
        {
            monthYear: string, //MM-yyyy
            spendings: [
                {
                    id: string
                    author: string, // (id/name?)
                    money: Money, // (amount, currency)
                    type: SpendingType,
                    title: string,
                    description: string,
                    date: Date
                }
            ]
        },
        {...}
    ]
}
```
```
POST /spendings/
request 
                {
                    author: string, // (id/name?)
                    money: Money, // (amount, currency)
                    type: SpendingType,
                    title: string,
                    description: string,
                    date: Date
                }

response 
                {
                    id: string
                    author: string, // (id/name?)
                    money: Money, // (amount, currency)
